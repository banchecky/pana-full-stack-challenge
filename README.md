## Pana Full-Stack Code Challenge

### The Challenge

The goal of this code challenge is to implement a sample front-end for one of our products, **Pana Flight Search**, using either React or Backbone/Marionette (_or another similar framework_). Further instructions will be presented when you first build the project.

### Installation

- **API**

  - Located in `/server`
  - `$ npm install`
  - `$ nodemon` (for hot loading rebuilds) or `$ npm start`

- **React Version**

  - Located in `/backbone`
  - `$ yarn install` or `$ npm install`
  - `$ yarn start` or `$ npm start`

- **Backbone / Marionette Version**

  - Located in `/backbone`
  - `$ npm install`
  - `$ npm run dev` to start the dev server

- **Another Framework**
  - If you would like to complete the challenge in another framework (Angular, Vue, etc.), you're welcome to do so, however you will be responsible for duplicating the code challenge in that framework prior to arriving at the interview.
  - Don't worry if you're not confident in Backbone/Marionette or React - We will gladly help you through framework related questions and your knowledge of a framework will not necessarily count against you and a lot of the following challenges are more focused on your knowledge of Javascript rather than a specific framework.

#### Core Requirements

- Work through this project according to the instructions page (this page will be the first thing that loads when the project builds)
- Use React, Backbone/Marionette, or another frontend JS framework
  - Part of our goal is to see how you work through problems including fetching from an api, interpreting unfamiliar data, and reasoning about sorting and filter, not necessarily how well you know certain frameworks.

### Evaluation

- **JavaScript**
  - Cleanliness and organization of your code
  - Your ability to effectively leverage a framework
  - Appropriate use of known development patterns
- **Fundamentals**
  - Ability to debug someone elses code and make changes
  - Ability to implement sorting and filtering
  - Clear knowledge of Javascript fundamentals and patterns
  - How you take unfamiliar data and understand it
  - How you handle unexpected errors and loading times

### Styleguide

- **Colors**
  - Background: #F8FCFF
  - Primary: #1A96FC
  - Secondary: #EE3690
  - Tertiary: #171AB2
  - Quaternary: #FEC61E
  - Quinary: #1BC98E
- **SASS** - All styles use the indented style styntax of SASS (no brackets).
- **Grid System** - We've included a grid system library that is very similar to our internally built grid library. Documentation can be found at `http://flexboxgrid.com/`.
